<h1>Project on Console</h1>    
<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Visual Studio Code is an application which helps us to do some advanced coding. First we have to download this app, then create a folder and open it with VSC. Then you can start writing your code into it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;"> Console screen is a screen in which we can view our errors and run JavaScript. It is open by right clicking on the screen and clicking on inspect. Then on the upper navigator, there will be an option of console or you can open it by the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I. Printing on console is simple. In your code, type console.log() and then type whatever you want to be printed in the console inside your brackets.   </p>

var first_name = "Anaira ";
console.log(first_name);
var last_name = "Jindal";
console.log(last_name);
var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
console.log(full_name);
var a = 10;
var b = 5;
var num_add = a + b;
console.log(num_add);
var num_subtract = a - b;
console.log(num_subtract);
var num_multiply = a * b;
console.log(num_multiply);
var num_divide = a / b;
console.log(num_divide);
